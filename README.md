# Bikesharing Data from New York


## Overview of the Project
In this project, I compared a multitude of data from a New York bikesharing company in order to evaluate the most successful way to start a bikesharing company.


## Results

### Checkout Times for Users

For this visualization, I compared the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. Between hours 0-1, the most common length of check out time was 5 minutes with 146,752 bikes.

### Checkout Times by Gender

Similar to the previous visualization, I compared the length of time that bikes are checked out based on gender. Men were way more likely than women to check out bikes.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

This visualization shows the frequency of checkouts based on the time and day of the week. The most popular riding times were between Monday-Friday, with high volume around 8 am, 5 pm, and 6 pm. 

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

Using another heatmap visualization, I compared popular riding times with days of the week based on gender. Although the trends of popular days and times were similar across genders, men were more likely than women to check out bikes.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
![Screen Shot 2022-07-03 at 4 20 11 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101145419/177059479-3741a772-4e03-4e44-9db9-70dd977184a1.png)
In this visualization, I compared the frequency of trips based on the days of the week, customer type, and gender. While the customers had a similar rate of rides across genders, male subscribers were substantially more likely than any other usertype of gender to ride.

### Bike Repairs

This visualization highlights which bikes are due for repairs based on the amount of times they've been used for rides. The darker color indicates a higher number of rides.

### August Peak Hours

This bar chart compares the number of rides in August to the time of day. As we saw earlier, the most popular riding times tended to be 8 am, 5 pm, and 6 pm, with 5 pm being the most popular riding time.


## Summary
These visualizations helped transform data into meaningful information that can give us insight into the bikesharing business model. The data showed that men were most likely to use the bikes. Subscribers were more likely to use bikes than customers. The most popular riding times were 8 am, 5 pm, and 6 pm, which likely correlates to the times that people are travelling to and from work. 

For further analyses, I'd suggest making more visualizations. One of my recommended visualizations would be comparing the birth year by gender to the number of bike rides. Another visualization could be comparing the usertype to the distance on average that is travelled per trip.
